### Data

Dataset is Seattle city collision data provided by the Seattle Police Department and recorded by Traffic Records.  It consists  ~194673 instances of collisions and ~38 attributes describing the event - severity of the accident, location, weather, collision type etc.  Collisions will be displayed at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. Timeframe of the data is 2004 to Present, thus it includes over 15 years of data that will help to see the trend over a decade.

This data will be explored to find what features most relevant to predict the severity of the accident.
